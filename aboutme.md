I have been working in IT for 8 Years, 3 of those doing application support for all lines of business at TD, over those years I have been able to learn how other teams and developers
work at TD as well as how the deployment process works and all the different environments like dev, pat, prod.
I went to Trios college for network administration after working for Teletech doing level 3 support, I am enthusiastic about devops, software engineering and cloud
and most of my free time is spent working on my home lab which is where I learn most of my skills, for the past year I have been working on shifting my stack to 
infrastructure as code and learning the technologies behind it. 

Over the last year and half I have learned more in depth linux knowledge as well as tools like ansible, foreman, docker and kubernetes.
I have been able to pick up knowledge in deploying docker environments and then setting up kubernetes on top of them using either kubeadm or rancher, it has allowed me to learn 
yaml and how configs for docker and kubernetes are put together, it also has helped me get used to working with git/github.

Lately I have been working on a homelab project on using rancher to deploy kubernetes and using opensource rancher catalogue items to deploy openstack on kubernetes from a 
private docker registry, although it is not indepth knowledge it has helped round out my operations skills with some development skills, in the next year im planning in 
studying for the rhcsa and the aws devops cert after that.

I believe I would be a good asset for your team and would love to speak with you more about what I could bring to the Mccormick team.
