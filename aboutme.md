> ## About me   
> 

I have been working in IT for 8 Years, 3 of those doing application support for all lines of business at TD.
I went to Trios college for network administration after working for Teletech doing level 3 support, I am enthusiastic about devops, software engineering and cloud
and most of my free time is spent working on my home lab which is were I learn most of my skills, for the past year I have been working on shifting my stack to 
infrastructure as code and learning the technologies behind it, lately I have been finishing getting openstack working on top of kubernetes, other than that I
also like flying quadcopters and gaming in my spare time.
